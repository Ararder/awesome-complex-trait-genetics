[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of awesome tools for human complex trait genetics, biased/slanted towards post-GWAS analysis.

How can you add your tool? via a pull request, if you dont know what that is, read the contributing guidlines: (https://github.com/MichelNivard/awesome-genetics/blob/main/contributing.md)


## genetic architecture

## Pleiotropy/multivariate modeling

- [GenomicSEM](https://github.com/GenomicSEM/GenomicSEM) R package for Genomic Structural Equation Models. user defined models of the relation between complex traits based on GWAS summary data.
- [coloc](https://github.com/chr1swallace/coloc) R package to perform genetic colocalisation analysis, test whether two related phenotypes share common genetic causal variant(s) in a given region.


## Mendelian randomisation

## Simulation

- [GWASBrewer](https://github.com/jean997/GWASBrewer) A flexible tool for simulating realistic GWAS summary statistics for one, or many, traits.

## Genomic data wrangling

- [bigsnpr](https://github.com/privefl/bigsnpr) R package for the analysis of massive SNP arrays, primarily designed for human genetics.
- [ukbrapR](https://github.com/lcpilling/ukbrapR) ukbrapR (phonetically: 'U-K-B-wrapper') is an R package for working in the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (RAP). The aim is to make it quicker, easier, and more reproducible.
- [MungeSumstats](https://github.com/Al-Murphy/MungeSumstats) R package designed to facilitate the standardisation of GWAS summary statistics.
